    "summary": "The panel discussion focused on advancing accessibility in XR (Extended Reality) technologies, featuring researchers Amy Pavel, Kyle Rector, and Martez Mott. Amy explored AI-driven tools for non-visual AR accessibility, including mobile AR apps for furniture placement and 360-video navigation. Kyle developed a non-visual VR adaptation of the game Showdown for visually impaired users, emphasizing audio cues and scaffolding techniques. Martez investigated physical accessibility barriers in commercial VR systems for people with disabilities like cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, identifying hardware challenges such as controller use and headset setup. All three highlighted the need for modular, adaptive designs and user-centered approaches.",
