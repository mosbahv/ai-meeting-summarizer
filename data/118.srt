1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,400
Marcus White: Marcus White is the Managing Director of Quartz Power Group, an energy company. Every month,

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,160
Marcus White: the departmental managers meet to discuss high-level issues in the company. Marcus is

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,379
Marcus White: leading this month's meeting.

6
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,599
Marcus White: Okay, well good morning everyone. Thank you very much for being here on time. We've got a lot to do today

9
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:33,270
Marcus White: so let's get started. Now everyone's here apart from John in Facilities, but we have apologies from him.

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:42,359
Marcus White: Has everyone got a copy of the agenda? Good. Okay, can I draw your attention to item 4 where it says

15
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,988
Marcus White: presentation of online survey results. The presentation is going to be given by Miss Patricia Reyes, who is a representative of the

18
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:01,350
Marcus White: research company we contracted to carry out the work. Now Miss Reyes will arrive at 11.30 so I plan to break at about

21
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:11,069
Marcus White: 11.15 to give her time to set up. It may also mean that we need to interrupt the first few agenda items, but we'll come back to those.

24
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,478
Marcus White: And lastly, I'd like to leave a little bit of time under any other business to discuss whatever might come out of the presentation.

28
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,500
Marcus White: Okay, so item 1 is relocation and plans for flexible working. Now as you know, Paul and his team have been working on plans to extend

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,500
Marcus White: flexible working hours across the company. So Paul, perhaps I can begin by asking you to fill us in on your progress.

35
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:53,399
Marcus White: Sure, thanks Marcus. Well as Marcus said.

36
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,069
Paul: Thank you very much indeed Paul. I mean on behalf of everyone I'd like to say thank you to you and to your team for all the hard

40
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,348
Marcus White: work that you've put in so far on this project. I really appreciate it. Before we move on to item 2, are there any comments anyone would like to make on item 1?

45
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:30,250
Maya: No? Maya, I'm aware that flexible working hours has a particular impact on some of your team. Do you have any thoughts on that?

48
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,639
Maya: Well, from my point of view what Paul is proposing sounds fine. I am a bit concerned about working with the system of core hours and then flexible hours,

52
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,239
Maya: but I think we all need time to read through Paul's proposal in more detail before discussing it any further.

55
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:56,979
Marcus White: Okay, that sounds reasonable. And what do other people think? Do you agree with Maya that we need to look through the proposal in more detail first?

59
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,900
Marcus White: Yes? Okay, right. Well, I'm sure we can return to it at next month's meeting. Okay, good. Are we all okay to move on to the next point?

62
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:20,650
Marcus White: Right, so the up and coming board meeting. We don't need to spend too much time on this, but there are one or two issues which we need to be aware of.

66
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:33,639
Lydia: Lydia, can you warn me if we go beyond 10 minutes on this one?

67
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:39,579
Lydia: So those two people will be replacing the two members of the board who are leaving us. And that's everything I think on item 2.

71
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,639
Marcus White: So right, moving on to item 3 and the cost breakdown for the relocation. Now, Maya, thank you very much for emailing the current figures to all of us.

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,289
Maya: I hope that we've all had time to look at them, to read them through. Maya, is there anything that you want to add before I open this up for questions?

78
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,788
Maya: Not really. Nothing's changed since it was sent out, as far as I know.

80
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:18,038
Marcus White: Are there any questions arising from Maya's report? Matt, you look as if you might have a question.

82
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,519
Matt: Yes, I suppose I do. Well, it's more of a comment really. The fact is, IT will have the highest cost attached to this relocation in terms of moving equipment and I'll also need to bring quite a few contract people to help.

89
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,720
Matt: But the figures in here don't seem to be the same as the estimates I gave you. It's all going to require a lot of overtime in my department.

92
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:47,439
Matt: Well, I have allocated some of the costs to the budgets of other departments. That seemed the fairest way to do it. Otherwise, as you say, IT is responsible for a large part of the relocation costs.

97
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,110
Marcus White: So do you mean in any IT cost related to say, marketing, will be covered by the marketing budget?

100
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,360
Marcus White: Yes, in a way. Look, this might help clarify it. You see, I've broken the IT department up into segments.

103
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,279
Marcus White: Oh, I'm sorry. Can we continue this discussion after lunch? The lady from the research company is waiting to join us and to present her results.

107
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:26,110
Marcus White: But before we take a break, I just want to summarize where we are so far. Now, my understanding is that Maya has tried to allocate the relocation costs across departments as far as is possible.

113
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:42,220
Marcus White: But that Matt feels that IT is still taking too many costs. Is that right?

115
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:49,478
Marcus White: That's about right.  Okay, let's take a break now. And can we all be back here promptly at 11.30 to continue where we left off?

118
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,800
Marcus White: Lydia, could you bring Ms. Reyes up, please?
